Ryland's Base Code for 7DRL 2015
================================
This is a collection of source files I will be starting with for 7DRL 2015.
It currently includes the basics for a simple entity component system (world.h,
world.c, and components.h) as well as a small abstraction over ncurses
(interface.h and interface.c.) It also includes a makefile which should compile
all .c and .h files, and include the ncurses and math libraries.
